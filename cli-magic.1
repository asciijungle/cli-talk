.SH "NAME"
\fBcli\-magic\fR \- an introduction to command line interfaces
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
just read it ;)
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is an introduction to the command line interface (CLI) of modern unix operating systems\. It provides an overview about the terminology, as well as the history of CLIs and shows how to use the command line for productive day to day work\.
.
.SH "HISTORY"
In the middle of the last century, early computers had rather primitive input/output interfaces\. Both the program code and the input data were read from punch cards\. The output of the computation would then be printed onto paper by printers attached to the computer\.
.
.P
This was a batch process workflow rather than in interactive user session\. In order to facilitate a proper utilization of those very expensive early machines, jobs piled up and programmers had to wait for a long time before getting the results of their programms compilation and then its execution\.
.
.SS "Teletypewriter"
In 1956 scientists at MIT were experimenting with attaching a teletypewriter to a computer to unify input and output\. Even before the invention of the computer teletypewriters have been used for communication replacing the morse code based telegraphy\.

\fICtrl\-C\fR
.
.P
You can use Ctrl\-C in your terminal to abort a running program\. This sends a SIGINT signal to the process currently executed by the shell\. Most programs interpret it similar to SIGTERM wich calls for graceful termination\.
.
.P
\fICtrl\-D\fR
.
.P
Ctrl\-D sends an end of line (EOL) character to the shell\. The shell interprets end of line as the end of user input\. It therefore has the same result as typing exit in the shell\.
.
.P
\fICtrl\-U\fR
.
.P
Ctrl\-U cancels the currently inputted command line\.
.
.P
\fICtrl\-K\fR
.
.P
Ctrl\-K cancels user input from the location of the cursor to the end of the line\.
.
.P
\fICtrl\-Z\fR
.
.P
Pause the currently executed program and return to the shell\. You can resume stopped processes with \fBfg\fR or \fBbg\fR\.
.
.P
\fICtrl\-R\fR
.
.P
triggers reverse search through the command line history\.
.
.P
\fICtrl\-L\fR
.
.P
Clears the current content of the terminal starting with a clean prompt\.
.
.SH "SHELL"
The Shell is the program directly connected to a terminal\. It provides an interactive programming language allowing you to invoke different programs as well as combining them to accomplish a certain outcome\. The difference between the shell and other interpreted programming languages like e\.g\. python is that in python most of the code is written to be run in the interpreter itself, whereas the shell is primarily starting other programs to to the work\.
